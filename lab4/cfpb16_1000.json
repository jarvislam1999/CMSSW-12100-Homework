Without doing all the details last year, I had to install an automatic call recorder on my cell phone number XXXX. \n\nI received a notification of a 30 day late pay from equifax. This appears to have occurred according to the credit reports ( all of them ) sometime in XXXX of 2015. I called in not aware that my cell was recording the call ( had forgotten ) Although I made a payment timely, it was not credited for whatever reason. The service rep who is employed by Capital One and identified himself as a Capital One Employee states on the recording that there was a system error when I made the payment thus not crediting it to my account nor removing it from my bank account. It is and has been Capital One 's position that there contract with the Credit bureaus does n't allow them to change this supposed late pay that was made timely and was not credited nor deducted according to their own employee as a result of a SYSTEM ERROR ON CAPITAL ONE 'S END. I do n't want to retain a lawyer but will and I am sure after they hear the recording which I have offered to let any capital one employee hear and they have refused. Capital One 's position is that we ca n't record calls. Fortunately, I live in XXXX and while substantive law may be in XXXX, the fact is that the recording was by mistake and was done in XXXX and is fully admissible in any court. The number is Capital One 's and the employee is clearly a Capital One employee. All I get is we are not going to change this. I have tried through Social Media and while a woman was very helpful she said she ca n't change it but offered no explanation other than it was late. I have sent numerous letters to XXXX and various addresses and still have gotten no response even though these were disputes by me according to the FCRA and FDCPA. All I want are the reports updated to show never late and remove the XXXX ding on this account for what the 2 or 3 years I have had it. Even if I was late which I deny, I do n't understand why as a gesture of good will, Capital One would n't remove it for a person who had just supported XXXX people after his wife was injured by a maniac surgeon ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX my now ex-wife is XXXX XXXX. ) I paid over XXXX XXXX in medical bills supported a family working XXXX hours per week and dont ' understand the lack of good will nor accountability here. I have been told the contract with the CRA 's requires this. The contract first of all has about XXXX exceptions and allows for updates for a bank or credit card company one time for good will and allows re-do 's when the bank has made an error. I do n't like filing this complaint. I would prefer not to eventually hire a lawyer and file complaints with multiple federal and state agencies. I just want my credit updated in accordance with my recorded conversation with the Capital One employee.

However, for some unknown reason, they did not do so this year and I received a notice in the mail from XXXX XXXX stating that my property insurance was being cancelled due to non-payment by the mortgage company. That arrived on Sat., XX/XX/XXXX, yet my insurance was due on XX/XX/XXXX!!!! Of course I had to wait until Monday to deal with the situation and I still ca n't believe what I went through that day!!!!!!!!!! In one day, I spoke with XXXX different people, I was disconnected at least 8 times, and had to tell my entire story over again each and every time I got a new person, most of whom could not speak or understand English. They told me they had never paid my insurance, that they did n't know why I wanted them to pay it, and that they could n't overnight the payment because they did not have a copy of my XXXX policy on file!!!! YET they had tried to force-place insurance on me 2 or 3 times in the 4 years they 've had the loan!!!!!!!!!!! As a result, I had to keep sending them a copy of the master policy showing that it was a condominium policy and that I was not responsible for insuring the outside. That 's how I KNOW they had a copy of it. My homeowner 's insurance was cancelled and almost not reinstated because they said they had to wait 5 to 7 days to send the payment, eventhough my agent faxed YET ANOTHER copy of the declarations page that morning!!!!!!!!!!! They have yet to offer me any explanation of why all of this happened. I did find out from the insurance company that the mortgage company did send XXXX XXXX a letter stating that they were refusing to pay the bill because they did n't recognize the loan. I have NO idea why they did n't, yet they paid it all 4 prior years, and they will not give me a reason, not even what the letter said that they sent to XXXX ( They did n't recognize the loan. ) This mess went on for a total of 10 days, with several calls a day and no help whatsoever!!!!!!!! Once I could finally breathe a sigh of relief that that was taken care of and I was insured ( Keep in mind that I had a pipe burst in my home in XX/XX/XXXX that cost {$150000.00} - {$200000.00} so I do n't take being uninsured lightly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ), I called the mortgage company back and told them I wanted to have all of the remaining money in my escrow account returned to me because I could no longer trust them and I was n't about to be uninsured or not have my taxes paid in the future.

I have copies of my faxed documentation that proves that I sent all requested valid information several times prior to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I was also told by Wells Fargo that their investor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX does not provide HAMP assistance. First Wells Fargo told me their investor does not approve or work with HAMP. Then Wells Fargo later told me I did not provide them with valid documents. I have since lost my home to foreclosure sale on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo did not bid my home which had a fair market value of {$450000.00} at fair market value. They started the bid at {$210000.00} which sold for {$260000.00} because the investor bidding on my home knew it was worth much more than the winning bid of {$260000.00}. Now I am out {$180000.00} of equity because Wells Fargo did not bid my former home at \" Fair Market Value ''. \n\nI truly believe that I was discriminated against on my HAMP and loan modification request by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. At the time of my loan modification request I was able to get out of underemployment and had landed a new job that gave me enough income to start paying my mortgage payments again if a modification plan could have been worked out. I sent Wells Fargo all my pay stubs from my new job as well as all my bank statement information. Once I told them I have the funds to start making mortgage payments again I was told by by the home preservation specialist that they could not validate my income, even after I send them pay stub information, copies of recent bank account statements and all the other income information they requested. I worked extremely hard to save my home. I got behind on my mortgage payments due to underemployment. I had been a Wells Fargo customer since XXXX on the home they recently foreclosed on. Wells Fargo did not loose one cent of money on my foreclosed property. They made {$550000.00} on my home, {$280000.00} on 15 years worth of payments and another {$260000.00} at the foreclosure sale. Wells Fargo also held the XXXX mortgage on my home and requested the Over Bid proceeds of {$53000.00} on my foreclosed home. Wells Fargo sent me in writing that my homes market value was {$320000.00} prior to taking my former home to foreclosure sale. They knew they could get all the money owed to them if they would have placed a fair market value on my home prior to the foreclosure sale. \n\nI truly feel that a huge injustice has taken place in the non-approval of my HAMP and Loan Modification Request. I should have been a candidate for being approved for either program. Since XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo has made over {$850000.00} off of my hard work. I paid a mortgage in full in XX/XX/XXXX on another mortgage I once had with Wells Fargo. Now 16 years of making mortgage payments is all gone. I have lost everything I have ever worked for because Wells Fargo continually came of with invalid reasons why I was not approved for a loan modification of approved for the HAMP program. I have paid Wells Fargo over {$850000.00} and now my home has been lost to foreclosure, all because of their discriminatory loan modification denial. Why would they not work with a long time loyal customer who needed temporary assistance. I have the all the paperwork to prove that I should have been approved for a loan modification plan. I was at Wells Fargo mercy and they deliberately decided not to approve my loan modification because of discrimination and greed. This injustice in pure evil and greed at work.

Payment was made via check, and was mailed, in accordance with the instructions, to XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. As I did not yet have a DiTech statement or an account number I sent a copy of the transfer letter ( from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Ditech ) along with my check. \n\nPayment was made via check drawn from my XXXX checking account. The check was made payable to \" DiTech Financial '', and was cashed by DiTech on XX/XX/XXXX. As I did not have a DiTech account number, I included my previous mortgage service ( XXXX XXXX ) account info on the check, thinking it would simplify the transfer completion. \n\nThe check was for {$2900.00}, slightly more than the {$2800.00} due ; I had indicated on the letter included with the check that the additional {$40.00} was to be applied to the principal balance. \n\nI 've made 2 phone calls, to no avail, and I 've submitted 2 separate requests via DiTech 's customer service portal. During the phone calls, the customer service representative was absurdly rude and extremely condescending even as I explained I had a copy of the cashed check ... she insisted that DiTech did not cash the check. It 's absolutely egregious that almost XXXX weeks after DiTech cashed my check, my mortgage account has not yet been credited, and DiTech ca n't tell me what they did with my check. \n\nI 'm well educated ( XXXX ) and have a federal job that requires me to maintain a good credit worthiness rating ; DiTech 's mishandling of the mortgage transfer and inability to credit my mortgage account with a payment made weeks ago is putting my credit rating at risk. Also, end of year tax statements will be inaccurate due to their mis-handling of my payment. \n\nTo make matters worse, as a result of my submitting a request for assistance via DiTech 's customer service portal on-line, I get a form letter that says, in part, that the communication is an attempt to collect a debt, from a debt collector. And, that they will reply in writing within 30 days. Unbelievable!!! Most ridiculous customer service model I 've ever heard of!! \n\nPut simply, I want the payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX, to be appropriately credited to my mortgage account, effective that day. This seems to me to be a very straight-forward matter ... I made a payment on time, DiTech cashed the check on XX/XX/XXXX and it still ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) has n't been credited to my mortgage account. \n\nI have attached a front and back copy of the cashed check ( made payable to DiTech ), as well as a screen shot of my bank statement showing that the payment was drawn from my checking account. These documents have been previously provided to DiTech, as well. \n\nPlease advise/assist. \n\nXXXX XXXX XXXX \n", "State": "VA", "Ditech Financial LLC": 3, "Complaint ID": "1729191", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "Yes", "Date sent to company": "01/08/2016", "Date received": "01/05/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "FHA mortgage", "Tags": "", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "235XX"}, {"Issue": "Other", "Company": "Credit Card Receivables Fund Incorporated", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "AZ", "Complaint ID": "1728488", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/11/2016", "Date received": "01/05/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit card", "Credit Card Receivables Fund Incorporated": 3, "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "85331"}, {"Issue": "Billing disputes", "Company": "Amex", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "AZ", "Complaint ID": "1727936", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "Yes", "Date sent to company": "01/05/2016", "Date received": "01/05/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit card", "Amex": 3, "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "85383"}, {"Issue": "Unable to get credit report/credit score", "Company": "Experian", "Experian": 3, "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "CA", "Complaint ID": "1728155", "Sub-issue": "Problem getting my free annual report", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Phone", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/05/2016", "Date received": "01/05/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "N/A", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "Servicemember", "Product": "Credit reporting", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with non-monetary relief", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "94611"}, {"Issue": "Dealing with my lender or servicer", "Company": "LTD Financial Services, L.P.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I set up a payment plan with LTD Financial Services to pay off XXXX of my XXXX private loans.

They have placed the full amount of the debt they state I owe on my credit report and have told me this will prevent me from getting credit in the future ( and it has ).

I am the owner of XXXX. I recently started this company selling goods on XXXX. I use PayPal to pay for my transactions with suppliers XXXX. I do this primarily because of the protection that PayPal provides to the buyer against fraud. \nI recently had my first experience where I needed this service and it seems that this service is actually Seller protection and not Buyer protection. Here is my story : I was running very low on a product that I sell ; my normal supplier went out of business so I needed another supplier quickly. There were no suppliers of this item on the website \" XXXX '' so I submitted a quote through a different website \" XXXX ''. I received about XXXX or more quotes from various suppliers for the selfie stick that I currently sell. \nThe selfie stick is Bluetooth and has LED lights on the clip that holds the cell phone. I eventually chose - XXXX XXXX with \" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ''. \nAfter many email communications to the Seller ( XXXX XXXX ) we established a price along with other details. \nOn XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was provided a quote ( PI ) for the product along with photos of the product. \nXXXX pcs for {$1200.00} plus shipping {$690.00} for a total of XXXX It was exactly what I needed. That same day ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) I paid for the product and the shipping via PayPal. \nOn XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the product arrives, but when I checked the product, I discovered that it was not the product that I ordered nor the product pictured on the Sellers Purchase Order ( PI ). It was in fact a cheaper version without LED lights. \nI contacted the supplier and told him what happened. He ( XXXX XXXX ) apologized a lot for the mistake. \nHis resolution was for me to purchase the correct clip with the LED lights from them and they would pay to ship them to me. Then I could open each of the XXXX boxes and replace the incorrect part with the correct part. So his fix was I buy XXXX correct clips at XXXX each ( {$1200.00} ) then I spend hours opening all of these and exchanging parts. \nThe solution I offered him was for me to return the product at his expense. He gets the shipping a lot cheaper than I do. And I paid for the shipping to me. \nMy XXXX product has now been out of stock and it has cost me about {$10000.00}. I do n't think I should have to pay again due to this seller 's deception. ( I honestly do n't think it was a mistake. ) I disputed this with PayPal on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I then escalated it to a claim on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX because the seller does not want to do the right thing and pay to have his product returned to him. \nOn XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received PayPal 's resolution to the claim. The resolution was for me to return the product to the Seller at my expense and they would refund the {$1900.00} to me once the seller has his product returned in the same condition it was sent. \nFor me this is absolutely ridiculous. It will cost me more than I paid for the product just to return it. I do n't get the discounts that they have. \nSo not only have I lost the current {$10000.00} in sales due to being out of stock. The sales momentum is now lost so the product is pretty much dead unless I re-due all of my marketing and promoting the product. I also lost the {$1900.00} that I spent to restock my product. \nThis seller is loosing absolutely nothing. Even if the seller pays to have the product returned, they are only out the shipping cost. While I have lost HUGE, I could not even get a response from PayPal. \nThey never asked to see the PI the Seller sent me ... nothing. \nI have proof of my loses. I have the ( SCAM ) PI provided by this seller. I have emails where the seller admits they made a mistake.

I wrote a letter of hardship to my current Mortgage company because of my low income status. My mortgage loan was originally with XXXX for over 20 years and they sold my loan to a company in New Jersey called Seterus Inc. After struggling to pay my mortgage, I contacted the company and advised them of my financial hardship and asked for a Modification to my payments. They advised me that I would be put under a HAMP program that the President had put in place to help homeowners to stay in their homes. They increased the mortgage from {$580.00} est to {$630.00} est. When I questioned this, I was told that I should have enough income to support the increase. During this time, I lost some income on my job and was n't bringing home enough to cover bills, food, car insurance, nor the car payment. After struggling several more months trying to pay everything, I continued to fall further behind. I again contacted the mortgage lender and advised that I was the only working person in the home, that my spouse was XXXX and did not work, and that because of the bills and limited income that I was receiving, I could n't pay my payments on time. I again asked for a hardship hoping that they would see my struggles. Again after sending in all the documents that they asked for, and speaking with them on the phone, I was made to feel belittled. I tried to explain to the rep my situation, and advised them again that I was not bringing home enough money to pay everything. They modified the loan again this time increasing the mortgage payment another {$180.00} more. They told me that in Virginia you have some type of public transportation and I stated yes we do but, with limited service serving hours. I was then told \" Well what you need to do is Sell your car and catch the bus to work, Then you should be able to meet your mortgage obligations ''. ( That is a direct quote from the rep. ) Not only did she speak to me in a very unpleasant tone, now my mortgage is {$770.00} and some cents. I again told them that I have to have a vehicle because, my husband is XXXX, and I do take him to his doctors appointments from time to time. I have to get to work and shop for groceries. That did n't matter to the person that I was speaking to. She made me feel like that 's the line all of us XXXX seem to have when they do n't pay their bills on time. I brought my home long before I got married, and I feel like I should n't be penalized because of the ZIP Code and demographic area that I live in. I have worked for over 30 years and pay taxes just like everyone else does that work. I have increased my education knowledge to meet the demands of our growing economy but without increasing finances. I have looked for other employment to help with my situation to no avail. My husband does not work and can not work. He is a Veteran and does the best he can to help out with bills with his limited income per month. It simply is not enough. I am behind in my mortgage this month XX/XX/XXXX months and I am desperate for help in trying to catch up the mortgage and stay in the home ... the more I fall behind the less help I seem to \" not be able to get ''. Due to all of these misfortunate events, my credit now is suffering which now makes it next to impossible to get help from anyone. I have tried to re-finance the home, borrow equity from the home and still ca n't get any help from any place or any one. \" I Need Help, PLEASE '' from somebody. I 'm not trying to lose my home.

PNC Bank has refused to delete, or correct, this information, in spite of their unfair and fraudulent practices ( set forth below ). \nThe XXXX XXXX payment was due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The amount due was {$230.00}. This payment was not made and a {$40.00} late fee was assessed, along with interest ; however, during the month of XXXX XXXX, PNC 's website reported an affirmative \" Next Scheduled Payment, '' dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, in the amount of {$230.00}, when in fact NO payment was scheduled. \nThe Account-holders reasonably relied upon this information and did not take additional steps to satisfy the XXXX XXXX payment ( believing that either a payment had been affirmatively scheduled by them, or that the account was enrolled in automatic deduction ). \nWhen the fictitious \" Next Scheduled Payment '' in the amount of {$230.00} was not made on XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( as indicated by PNC 's website ), the Account-holders affirmatively scheduled a payment on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, in the amount of {$450.00}.

Suspension of Automatic Deduction Sometime prior to XXXX XXXX, the Account was enrolled in an automatic deduction, wherein the minimum payment due was withdrawn from my Account-holders ' PNC Bank Checking Account automatically and applied to the Account. Sometime prior to XXXX XXXX, this feature was disabled by PNC without the permission or knowledge of the Account-holders. \nb.

I was very upset with XXXX and looked into M and T as an alternative and was impressed with what they had to offer. HOWEVER, now having been with M and T bank I will NEVER bank with them again. On numerous occasions M and T bank has imposed a {$38.00} fee to my account because they are processing pending debits BEFORE processing pending credits that will more than amply cover any pending transaction. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke with a Supervisor named XXXX ( she was the XXXX person that day I spoke to after being on the phone for more than an hour ). I had \" overdrafted '' by {$26.00} because M and T processed a pending check before they processed my pending payroll. XXXX understood this and somehow was able to reverse the fee I was charged even though it seemed that was going to be an impossibility based on previous fee reversals ( some I admit and take responsibility for and some are from these exact same circumstances ). On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX they reversed the fee per XXXX 's request. Today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I am in the same boat as they are charging me for \" overdrafting '' by {$3.00} when I had a pending credit of a higher amount. The debit was my mortgage payment that had NOT posted as of midnight on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( or XXXX/XXXX/XXXX am depending on how you look at it ) however on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at around XXXX my account shows my mortgage payment having been posted on XXXX ( which it had not, it posted on the XXXX ) and it showed a credit pending for XXXX in an amount higher than the {$3.00} I supposedly went over by. My account balance was {$0.00} ( a positive amount ) when they charged me a {$38.00} fee for overdrafting!!! This is bad business, you should not make money off of your customers based on when you decide to processing pending items. I repeatedly asked the Supervisor, XXXX ( employee id XXXX ) to send me to the retention or to the customer complaint department to which she finally shared with me that M and T bank does not have these sorts of departments within their organization. Well let 's just say, I 'm not surprised. \n\nXXXX had a grace period so that if you did happen to overdraft based on process timing such as this you would not be charged a fee. If it was due to your own error, as long as you fixed the discrepancy within ( I think ) 24 hours they would NOT assess a fee. They would also not charge a fee if the amount was under {$10.00} ( which I thought was a Federal mandate but maybe not ). \n\nM and T bank is very creatively capturing my money and I am sure many other customers money with this clever practice of charging a fee based on the timing of THEIR processes, nothing to do with the client and even less to do with overdrafting. As a single mom living paycheck to paycheck every cent counts. {$38.00} may not make most people bat an eye but to me that 's groceries for a few days or gas for the week. I believe if there was a class action suit against them that many many clients would fall into the right category to qualify to sue M and T based on this issue.

purchase a house. The escrow was originally set to close at the end of XXXX XXXX. It was then pushed back to XXXX XXXX because we had a short sale on our prior home XXXX of XXXX and for the VA loan it had to be 2 years. That was all fine but then the escrow date moved to XXXX XXXX, XXXX according to XXXX \" just to make sure we can make the deadline. '' XXXX XXXX rolls around and we find out that XXXX had not ordered a termite inspection which is mandatory with a VA loan. Our agent called an inspector who was gracious enough to make us a priority and come out the same day. Escrow finally closed on XXXX XXXX with no help from XXXX but by the assistance of our realtor and his mother. When we went to sign the last of the loan docs and the statement said we would be receiving over {$2400.00} back in the form of a check and we questioned that since we had only put down {$1000.00} in good faith. When we got the check for {$2000.00}, we again questioned our escrow agent and she informed us that the mortgage company had given us a credit and this was how they were accounting for it. Just after XXXX, I received a call from XXXX saying that and internal audit had been done ( again, later in the process than normal ) and we had to return the extra money and he would e-mail me with details on how to do that. He never did. I did get a call from our escrow company saything that they had heard from American Pacific Mortgage about the extra money but she said she told them that she could not be sure if we still even had the money. She never mentioned bringing her a check. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received an e-mail from XXXX as a \" follow-up '' about the Overpayment and he said that the VA was aksing for it and the escrow company said they did not have a check. I replied that he never e-mailed me to give me direction on what was to happen. He responded that the escrow office said they called me and that the check was to be returned to them. Thereby, in my option, blaming the escrow company for not informing me when he said he would. I did give a check to the escrow company in the amount of {$1000.00} that this morning, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It seems to me, that the mortgage company and XXXX XXXX should have been on top of this situation and not put us in the position of having to return money we questioned not once but 2 times. Buying a house is a stressful enough process without the loan officer forgetting things and then the loan company making a huge mistake. On top of that, founding out that we are responsible to return money the mortage company give us. This is just a poor way to do business. \n", "State": "CA", "Complaint ID": "1729772", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/06/2016", "Date received": "01/06/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "VA mortgage", "Tags": "", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "923XX"}, {"Issue": "Deposits and withdrawals", "Company": "USAA Savings", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I Had XXXX deposited into my account at usaa federal savings the money never posted to be used by us.

If the website were my only concern, I would not write this complaint ; however, here are several of my other concerns : 1. Customer Service line is busy each time I have called and eventually, the line goes dead or it states that they are too busy to answer the call and the line hangs up. The only instance where this does not occur is if you call collections ( how convenient for them ). I have never intentionally missed a payment on any card and the experience is less than favorable. \n2. When I requested to speak to a manager/supervisor or person with authority on several occasions, I was either denied or my request was met with a considerable amount of attitude.

XXXX, and I, XXXX XXXX, applied for a new home loan.

After thoroughly explaining our current situation and that we were not late, the first person she spoke with told her that she understood, but could not help, so she transferred me to the collections department. After explaining again, the person in collections, told her that I our account was not delinquent, and she was sorry but there was nothing she could do, that she would have to transfer her to Finance. Again, she had to re-explain everything, and was told that our account was not delinquent and that they would have to transfer her to Accounts Services. Again, she explained everything, the gentleman, informed her that they had been up dating their systems and for whatever reason, he could only see certain months. Of which, what he could see we were not delinquent, but that as much as he wanted to help the only people in the company, at this point that he knew could see all information, was Finance. He apologized, and said he would have to forward her to Finance, again. So, for the 5th time, she re-explained everything. After looking at our account she was told that we were not showing delinquent, and that she did not understand why it was showing on my credit report, that I would have to dispute that with the credit bureau. Even though, she asked her if there was something that she could email or fax us. She then responded with I could mail you something, but ultimately you have to dispute it with the credit bureau. So I asked again, at that point she asked me to hold to see what she could do. When she came back on the phone she said that our account was \" all of a sudden '' showing past due. When asked to explain. She said we called you in XX/XX/XXXX to let you know and you said to call back at XXXX. She told to her that she informed the person that it was impossible, because our account was set up to auto withdraw from our checking account, and that she was working and that was why. She also informed her that we never received any calls back, and the house phone at that time forwarded to her cell. So there is no way we would 've missed it nor did we receive any voicemails. She also explained that, \" We had noticed XX/XX/XXXX that the XX/XX/XXXX payment had not been pulled out so that is when she called and asked what was going on. The young lady she spoke with explained that she could see it was auto drafted before, but could not figure out why it all of a sudden stopped. She asked if we could set up a payment for that day my wife asked if it could wait until the end of the month with no penalty, due to her having started a new job and us waiting on her first paycheck. She said as long as it was paid by XX/XX/XXXX it would not count against us. My wife then asked if we could reset up the payments to auto debit from the same checking account, just like it had before prior to this, seeing as my husband nor myself, did NOT ever requested it be stopped. She said yes, that would be no problem, we set it up and reassured my wife that nothing would go against us on our credit past or present. '' After explaining this to the woman in finance, she told my wife well there is nothing I can do except tell you to dispute it with the credit bureau. So after being transferred 4 times and speaking with XXXX people, of whom all XXXX said that the account was not delinquent, then all of a sudden it is, we are still in the same spot. \n", "State": "TX", "Complaint ID": "1739239", "Sub-issue": "Account status", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/12/2016", "Date received": "01/12/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit reporting", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "773XX"}, {"Issue": "Incorrect information on credit report", "Company": "Equifax", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "TX", "Product": "Credit reporting", "Complaint ID": "1738260", "Sub-issue": "Information is not mine", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/12/2016", "Date received": "01/12/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Equifax": 3, "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "79407"}, {"Issue": "Incorrect information on credit report", "Company": "Experian", "Experian": 3, "Consumer complaint narrative": "regarding case XXXX Experian did nothing to fix this issue.

My supporting documentation shows that my loan was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, this is the same loan documented at the time of my original assumption request back in XXXX. Chase is also asking me to justify information that is public knowledge ( i.e ) the terms for General Purpose loans with the TSP.

B of A subsequently acquired Countrywide -- B of A does not issue bi-monthly mortgages and their computers do not recognize them. B of A computers register the first payment of the month ( as being deficient ) and do n't register the second payment at all.

This year the mortgage folks passed us off to collections which is where B of A is now dealing with all of the Countrywide bi-monthly mortgages. \n\nWhen the foreclosure issue was initially resolved, I asked our branch VP how many people B of A had thrown out of there houses for this same accounting problem, she admitted \" probably a lot ''. \n\nPlease have B of A fix this issue.

We were sent a notice stating that our monthly payment would increase due to changes to our escrow account, so we sent a check in the amount of {$1200.00} to cover the additional escrow and eliminate the increase in our monthly payments. The check was negotiated by OCWEN and applied to our account ; however, we later received a partial refund of the escrow. A few months later, we received notice that the refund was sent in error.

My account was then scheduled for closure all my checks written ahead of that time were returned and debits as well causing me to incur fees with those parties as well as damage my reputation further, my scheduled deposits were frozen as well causing me to miss my mortgage payment as well. Chase then sent me a letter regarding the account closure and also threatened that they would report this have it put on my credit report and inform other banks so I ca n't open an account anywhere. I was a victim of fraud and alerted Chase to this they took it upon themselves to process this check into my account even after the fact how am I liable? Besides the threating letter the lack of communication at Chase bank is appalling, as there customer service and fraud department gave me a different excuse every time. I understand that the bank reserves the right as to how to handle accounts my only issue is that I do n't want this to affect my credit, reputation, or ability to open a bank account as I exercised integrity and was forthright in this whole process. \n", "State": "IL", "Complaint ID": "1729631", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/07/2016", "Date received": "01/07/2016", "JPMorgan Chase & Co.": 3, "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "Checking account", "Tags": "Servicemember", "Product": "Bank account or service", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "604XX"}, {"Issue": "Incorrect information on credit report", "Company": "TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "This item is reporting on my Trans Union credit report. \nXXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , SC XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX I believe this item is a collection account for XXXX .

I purchased my house new and have lived at this house for 30 years as of this past XXXX XXXX. We started with XXXX Mortgage then the loan has been shuffled around over the years to quite a few companies including XXXX XXXX Mortgage and Homeward Residential. Lastly we found ourselves being serviced by Ocwen Mortgage. I had absolutely no say or real notice of these transactions over the years. I presumed that this was a common practice for servicing companies and banks. A few days ago I received a letter from a company I had not heard of before named XXXX. Nationstar documents they sent to me stated they were now in charge of servicing my mortgage. Again I presumed this was just normal day to day banking activity UNTIL I read the documents from XXXX stating that the documents from Ocwen claim that I was delinquent for the past 6 months. THAT IS AN OCWEN LIE! I called Ocwen over and over again only to be shuffled between XXXX and the XXXX. No one would give me a straight answer as to where my payments had been going. I went to my bank, XXXX Bank in XXXX California, as well as checking all of my online activity. All documents confirmed that each payment was made on time and that Ocwen had received and cashed each check. Apparently the payments were either credited to someone else 's account of were stolen by an Ocwen executive. Upon further investigation I found numerous charges ranging from fees and insurances which were unfounded. I have always had insurances and had always notified Ocwen proof of insurance directly from our HOA and private insurance company XXXX. Next of course I called XXXX and explained these facts to XXXX people in several different states. I finally was able to be contact XXXX XXXX at XXXX in XXXX California. He was and has been very helpful in trying to untangle this accounting mess. I searched online and found that Ocwen has been deceiving clients like me for years and has been levied with millions of dollars in fines by CFPB. Apparently Ocwen has been collecting payments from many of their clients as me and not applying the accounting. Then Ocwen shuffles us to other service providers with documents stating we are delinquent, in my case 6 months ( A LIE ). Ocwen pockets ( steals ) these funds leaving us with destroyed FICO scores, decimated financial reputations, delinquent status, threats of foreclosures, and a cold shoulder. I have documents from my bank that Ocwen received the funds and \" cashed the checks ''. A guess would be that someone at Ocwen has hidden my money in an executive 's XXXX bank account. XXXX has promised not to move forward with any foreclosure nor fines and fees until this is resolved.

XXXX from the Washington, PA office called me at the end of XXXX. I was told that they are now offering to do an auto refinance and take a personal loan out with a refinance. I have had some credit issues and I was taking out the personal loan to get caught up with some bills and expenses. I was told that if I made XXXX payments to my mortgage company they could get the loan done, that they had talked to underwriting and a manager and pushed it through. She asked me if I could make the payments to my mortgage company then, which I could not and I said I could make them later in XXXX and she said ok that 's fine and that the loan would just stay in pending. I then got a letter from One Main saying that my loan application was still there and they were waiting on additional information, which would have been the proof that I made the XXXX payments. So on Tuesday XXXX, I called One Main and I asked them just to confirm, \" As long as I make these XXXX payments they will they will get this loan done. '' I said I have late charges on my mortgage too and they told me no that I just needed to pay the XXXX regular mortgage payments. On Wednesday, XXXX I called my mortgage company to make the payments. Thursday, XXXX morning I sent them a screen shot from my XXXX, showing that I had made the payments and I had also called them at about XXXX when they opened, at about XXXX I called them back and they stated they were working on another application but that she would get back to me. By XXXX I still had never heard from her and I called her back again and at that point she told me she was doing everything she could to push this loan through, and I said that I did n't understand because she had told me all I needed to do was make these XXXX payments. I then said, \" Well what 's the problem? \" XXXX stated that they told her its because I had late charges still due. I said that does n't make sense. She agreed and said, \" I know, I do n't know what the problem is because you made your XXXX regular mortgage payments. '' I than emailed them proof stating that my loan was just due for XXXX XXXX, 2016 which was what XXXX told me it needed to be due for ( I was XXXX payments behind, they wanted me to make it due for the current month to approve the loan - as XXXX explained ). I never heard back from XXXX or XXXX the Manager in Washington. I called back again and spoke with the Washington Manager XXXX, he said that he was going to talk to his District or General Manager about it and get back to me and never did. I called on Friday, XXXX early in the morning because I did n't hear back from XXXX. He insisted that he did call me back and I have no missed calls and none in my call log at all. I also verified through XXXX that I did not have any incoming calls from One Main the evening of XXXX and have proof of this. XXXX stated that he had talked to XXXX and she said she never told me she would get the loan approved. I stated XXXX is not telling the truth and he could n't even tell the truth about calling me back. I asked him if he felt his business had INTEGRITY. He said it did. They lie - that 's not a definition of integrity. I asked XXXX if he could call me and leave a voicemail on my cell phone with his bosses contact information ( I was driving and could n't write it down or put it in my phone ). He said he could n't do that due to state regulations. I asked him what this specific regulation was as I 've never heard of anything like that. He then stated it was internal policy. Again, lies.

It is my understanding that regardless of any outcome, they are simply regarding the matter ''closed. '' I strongly disagree ; the matter is far from closed. \nWhile we have been negotiating for more than six months, I believe Ocwen has failed to negotiate with me in a truthful manner. \nThrough mediation on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we reached an agreement that called for a principle reduction of some {$170000.00}, for a loan of XXXX, at 2 % interest, for 40 years. Those terms were to take effect in XXXX of XXXX, after I had made XXXX trial payments of {$2500.00}. I made those XXXX payments. \nHowever, the contract I received from Ocwen differed greatly from the agreement I was led to believe we had reached in mediation. Not only that, Ocwen had taken it upon themselves to change definitions. The contract I received called for principle deferment, with a balloon payment of some {$170000.00} at the end of the contract. That term, principle deferment, was never mentioned in any previous discussions with Ocwen and was not mentioned in our mediation session. \nAt our second mediation session, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I objected to this switch. Also, the mediator agreed that principle reduction and principle deferment are XXXX different terms and should not be used interchangeably. In fact, the mediator said she had never seen any bank or loan service company try to use them interchangeably. Principle reduction is what it mean, XXXX principle reduction, she said. \nWhen questioned, Ocwen 's legal representative replied that principle reduction and principle deferment were XXXX and the same. \nIn addition, I presented a letter - dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX - from yet another Ocwen employee, an account analyst who signed his name as XXXX XXXX, stating that he would not be able to reply to my principle reduction/principle deferment complaint until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Of course, that letter led me to believe I had until then, at least, to respond to Ocwen 's surprising offer. I asked for another month from that to consider, thinking perhaps the terms would change. Ocwen 's legal representative spoke on the phone with someone from the company, who said I had to accept or reject the offer by Friday, XXXX XXXX. \nI then asked how could the deadline be XXXX XXXX, when your own employee said he could n't answer until the XXXX? I was told, again, that my deadline was the end of the week. \nA third mediation session was scheduled for XXXX XXXX. I have since received another letter - dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX - from another Ocwen employee, an account analyst who signed her name XXXX XXXX, stating that she could not answer my complaint until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I have to ask, what 's the point, if Ocwen has already ignored the work done by XXXX XXXX? \nI left that XXXX XXXX meeting with the firm belief that Ocwen has never negotiated in good faith, and that, although Ocwen may well consider the matter closed, it is anything but. \nI strongly believe that Ocwen has been unfair, deceitful, and abusive in its dealings with me. I believe Ocwen has violated the protections afforded to consumers as provided by Dodd-Frank. I believe that Ocwen wants to brush this aside. I believe that Ocwen anticipates that I will buckle under the pressure of the XXXX high stack of paperwork they have sent me. I will not. \nI would like, with the help of your office and the office of your ombudsman, to reach the legally correct outcome to this dispute and have Ocwen honor its original offer - a principle reduction of some {$170000.00}, a loan of {$400000.00} at 2 % for 40 years, with no balloon payment and no hidden/disguised principle deferment. \nThank you for your attention to this matter. \n", "State": "NJ", "Complaint ID": "1743912", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Date received": "01/16/2016", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/16/2016", "Ocwen": 3, "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "Conventional fixed mortgage", "Tags": "", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "076XX"}, {"Issue": "Communication tactics", "Company": "Community Choice Financial, Inc.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I am having financial difficulties and XXXX XXXX XXXX continuously calls my cell and work phone.

I am submitting this complaint as a last resort. \n\nI opened the Capital One Mastercard at hand on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Several years ago I put the card aside in favor of another, leaving the account open paper statements and automated payments on, in case any charge was incorrectly billed, or a statement not received. I have not used the card in over 3 years. \n\nOn XXXX XXXX, XXXX a charge of {$11.00} was erroneously submitted to my Capital One Mastercard. I was never alerted to the charge, never received a statement reflecting the charge, mailed or electronic, for the month it was billed, or the next. Capital One nonetheless added a late payment charge to my account, and then another, plus interest, while failing to send a statement or alert that there was a balance on the account. I received no phone call, email, or other contact. My contact information is and was correct and up to date. Similarly, my account had automatic payments setup to avoid such a situation, and no automatic payment was submitted or applied. I only learned of the balance from a credit monitoring service after Capital One reported negative information on my credit report. \n\nI take my credit, reported information, and scores very seriously. I am vigilant about paying my bills and always paying on time. I have XXXX negative items on my credit reports, that is, until XXXX XXXX, when Capital One incorrectly reported the above as a missed payment, to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. \n\nEven after being alerted to their error, Capital One refuses to do anything to correct the mistake. In fact they act intentionally to reaffirm the information they report, without reviewing that it is correct. \n\nFiling a dispute with the CRAs is useless. Capital One 's nvestigations into disputes are automated, include no human review, and rely solely on the self-reinforcing data they have previously provided. No actual verification takes place. Blanket, automated confirmations sent in response to disputes. Investigations and review of their responsibilities to furnish accurate and complete information are instant, and even take place on weekends and holidays during which Capital One business offices are closed. \n\nCapital One does not take seriously or respond to requests for review, completely disregarding their responsibilities and requirements as a furnisher of data to consumer reporting agencies. They have XXXX regard for the devastating financial and personal harms they have caused by incorrectly reporting negative information. \n\nI want to close my accounts and sever any and all relationships I have with Capital One, but am afraid that if I am to close my account they will never fix this issue. It is for this reason I turn to submitting a dispute, in the hope that the error is corrected on my credit report, and that Capital One does not continue doing this to others. \n", "State": "MA",

I applied online and, depsite excellant credit, was approved for {$3500.00}, a limit no where near high enough limit to meet my needs.

I asked why they could not just use the one they pulled XXXX minutes before and was told that was impossible. I agreed to have by credit report pulled again and asked for a limit of {$23000.00}. I was told that the request was pending but that I could call back in the morning to speak to someone in XXXX XXXX. This morning, I was informed by XXXX XXXX that my request last night had been submitted for {$230000.00} and that if I wanted to request \" another '' increase they would have to run my credit again.

I agreed to have my credit run again and further re-explained that I needed the card for a balance transfer and that if the limit was not sufficient then the product did not meet my needs. The XXXX XXXX Representative offered me a 'counter offer ' of {$10000.00}. As previously stated, this did not meet my needs so I declined the offer. I was then informed that I would be receiving my card for {$3200.00} in the mail.

At first, she acted professional, but later on she became very rude and uncooperative. I had taken out a private student loan through XXXX XXXX about 6 or 7 years ago, and am still paying on it. I moved from XXXX at the end of XXXX XXXX, and let XXXX know that I did n't have a mailing address yet but that I would give it to her once I set up a XXXX XXXX XXXX She called me several weeks later asking if I had received the document proving that I owed money to the school, and when I asked her where she had sent it, she said it went to XXXX. I reminded her that I left a voicemail as soon as I moved to XXXX and got my XXXX XXXX XXXX with my new mailing address, but she became very rude and said that she sent it and was n't going to send it again. She also called me \" uncooperative '', when I have been trying to do everything I can to figure out what is going on. She has been calling me ever since then, even at strange hours of the evening ( XXXX my time, XXXX her time ). This is all very odd, especially since I have not changed my phone number since I attended the school, so I do n't see why they never called me in the past 6-7 years if I somehow did owe them money. I have even tried calling the said school several times, but have not heard back. I work at a bank, and have heard of a few debt collection agency scams recently going on, so I know better than to just send off money to them without questioning it. So far, I have not had any proof of anything that I have signed saying I owe this school money. I am still paying XXXX XXXX for the student loan, and everything that has occurred thus far has led me to believe this is fraudulent. It also seems that XXXX has violated the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act. It would make sense to me that if I did indeed owe money to the school, they would probably contact me, and XXXX would have happily updated my address when she was on the phone with me last time ( rather than being rude and saying that she already sent the document proving I owed the debt, and that she was n't going to send it again ).

I have submitted disputes on XXXX occasions attempting to correct this issue : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX - XXXX Equifax did not correct the status of the acct to Paid, Closed but instead it has removed all status and left it blank.

I called XXXX XXXX who insisted they report correctly. As it stands now, I filed XXXX complaint XXXX against XXXX XXXX who responded on XXXX XXXX XXXX with a letter ( attached here ).

The above report shows that Equifax did not do any kind of investigation, it did not report correctly and it made false statements as show is their so called verification of data. \nI filed XXXX complaint XXXX against XXXX XXXX who responded on XXXX XXXX XXXX with a letter ( attached here ). Based on this letter it is clear that Equifax is at fault for willful negligence in not removing the Collection mark for the month of XXXX because XXXX XXXX is reporting correctly.

The XXXX was still not forthcoming and on XXXX XXXX, 2015 Wells Fargo added another {$2500.00} to the loan. I contacted Wells Fargo about the extension fees, and additionally brought to their attention that mortgage rates had dropped to approx 3.6 % while they were charging me {$3700.00} to extend the rate. I started the process to look into refinancing with our present lender XXXX and brought this to the attention of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo agreed to reduce the rate by 1/8 to 3.875 % and told me that XXXX would not approve my loan, and that I needed to close the loan with them. I was taken aback by this brash behavior, essentially strong arming me to close on a loan with at a rate that was at least .25 % higher than what I had been quoted. Since I was still undecided to accept these terms or not, Wells Fargo offered to forgo the rate lock fees, but demanded that I close the loan in a matter of days. \n\nI felt that I was being pushed to make a bad decision in haste.

It did not. Instead it took four days of my checking and persistent calling for the large transaction to be correctly applied against the principal of the loan.

During this time I have continued to pay my house payment along with {$200.00} to {$400.00} extra per month. When I realized that my back payment was not decreasing I contacted Chase and was told that they were holding the extra money because they could n't apply it until they received a full payment. In the mean time my note is increasing further and further behind. Each time I contacted Chase they would tell me to re apply and to appeal my modification. Each time I was denied for different reasons. The only thing that they offered me is a short sale for my home. I am so stressed and tired of dealing with Chase that I 'm going to put my home up for short sale. \n", "State": "LA", "Complaint ID": "1724150", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/01/2016", "Date received": "01/01/2016", "JPMorgan Chase & Co.": 3, "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "FHA mortgage", "Tags": "", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "707XX"}, {"Issue": "Loan modification,collection,foreclosure", "Company": "Wells Fargo & Company", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I bought a house in XX/XX/XXXX. At the time my income was from XXXX insurance which would end the next year. Despite knowing I had insufficient income for the mortgage payments, Wachovia gave me a predatory loan at 6.5 % interest rate, much higher than other people. I could n't afford to keep paying the mortgage, so I moved in with family and rented the house out to pay for the mortgage. I always paid the mortgage on time, until the last tenants left the house in XXXX, without paying their last month 's rent, and leaving approximately {$10000.00} of damage. Thus, I could n't pay the mortgage without getting rent, as I used the last of my savings to make the repairs. This meant that my mortgage went into arrears. Within a few weeks of not making my mortgage payment, I contacted Wells Fargo, to inform them of my situation and to ask about a refinance or home modification. I explained that I did not have the documents available to me at that time, and that my priority was getting the house repaired and re-rented - and then I would have the income to resume my mortgage payments and to focus on a home modification. Since then, I have repeatedly asked Wells Fargo to provide me with an email address as an easy method of communication, given that I reside XXXX, and there is a huge time difference and cost for phone calls to Wells Fargo. They have repeatedly ignored my requests to facilitate the home modification application by providing me with email contact. I began receiving rent again and was in a position to resume the mortgage payment but I was not willing to resume payments if WF had already started the foreclosure process. At this time, they are communicating with me by snail mail to XXXX, which takes 2 weeks to reach me. Therefore, if they state in a letter that the foreclosure process has not been started, it is so out of date by the time it reaches me, that the foreclosure process may have been started in the weeks that the letter took to reach me. I have had letters from them ( one of which appeared to be a form letter ) that state that I was not interested in a home modification, yet I have repeatedly stated both verbally and in writing that I wish to pursue a home modification. If my predatory loan interest rate of 6.5 % had been a normal rate over the past 10 years, with what I have paid, I would have paid off at least half of the mortgage by now, and not facing this horrible situation. Also, according to the terms of the National Mortgage Settlement, Wells Fargo was required to reach out to borrowers who were up to date with their mortgage payments and offer modifications, but WF never did this. \nOne of the letters from XXXX XXXX at WF, was contradictory about appointing a single point of contact, at one point saying it was not possible, but later saying the person would be XXXX XXXX. I contacted her, but my call went to VM and I have not been called back. \n\nPreviously I had a condo mortgage with WF, and due to tenant damage, I again had problems paying the mortgage, but because WF owned that loan ( not merely servicing it ), they did provide a single point of contact, and she not only emailed me regularly, but also called me at my home in XXXX, and a suitable resolution was reached. WF sold my mortgage to \" investors '' ( in a tranche of toxic mortgage assets ) and failed to inform me, under the requirements of the Truth in Lending Act. Now it seems that WF prefers to get the fees from a foreclosure than to assist me to keep my property. By refusing to provide me with a fast, efficient means of communicating, by email, they have cost me several additional, unnecessary late fees. \n\nI want the late fees for the past 4 months reversed, and I want WF to provide me with the email address for XXXX XXXX and instruct her to assist me, via email, with a home modification. WF has acted in bad faith and this must stop. \n", "State": "", "Complaint ID": "1746838", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/19/2016", "Date received": "01/18/2016", "Wells Fargo & Company": 3, "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "Conventional fixed mortgage", "Tags": "Older American", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": ""}, {"Issue": "Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed", "Company": "Gordon, Aylworth & Tami, P.C.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I was garnished by a collection agency that I did n't even have a chance to answer their claim against me.

I also checked on XXXX site as well as XXXX credit card 's site to confirm and Macy 's was clearly written as a participant. XXXX card is having a promotion wherein transactions would receive 10 % cash back of the total amount transacted, if used with XXXX Pay in-store. \nI saw some pieces of jewelry at Macy 's amounting to around {$10000.00} and wanted to buy them for my sister and mother. I however did not have the XXXX Pay/XXXX card set up, so I went home to get those. \nAlso, AFTER confirming with Macy 's on the phone and website XXXX as well as with XXXX at their store and online AND with XXXX online and on the phone ; I was sure that Macy 's would honor XXXX Pay, and so then I came back to Macy 's within 2 hours to buy and was informed now that Macy 's does not support XXXX Pay. \nI have now technically LOST 10 % of my transaction amount in XXXX Cash-back. I would like Macy 's to please refund me 10 % of the transaction amount that I have now lost in cash back due to Macy 's deceptive advertising around XXXX Pay availability. \nI was hence Forced by Macy 's to use the Macy 's credit card for the transaction which is absolutely unfair and incorrect behavior. \nI had put another piece for around {$8000.00} on hold and was going to buy that as well on my XXXX XXXX, but after being informed of Macy 's stance on XXXX Pay/Discover card, I chose at that point to leave those XXXX additional pieces of jewelry aside from my purchase order. \nThe said transaction for the XXXX piece of jewelry is said to hit my account on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and I want Macy 's to refund me 10 % of that transaction to address the loss I have had to incur due to not being allowed to use XXXX Pay/Discover at the Macy 's store. I have included relevant links for your validation in the email above. \nOn subsequent follow-ups over the last 2 months, Macy 's reps have been extraordinarily rude and defensive and simply unwilling to hear me out. On several occasions, I had to request the reps to stop 'interrogating ' me or to not interrupt my sentence prior to my finishing my thoughts. I was provided ultimatums and told in many nuances what a miserable individual I was ( the recordings at Macy 's would concur ). At this point, I had to take a stance as well and be more forceful in my responses. \nXXXX of the Macy 's Exec office rep ( PLEASE listen to her recorded conversation with me as well - XXXX XXXX ) pretty much informed me to follow her terms or pretty much go to XXXX. My cards on the Macy 's card website have also been blocked so I can not see any balance information etc. I would imagine this is breaking some Regs out there. I also informed XXXX XXXX that if they applied the said credit against the 0 % APR balance, Macy 's would only benefit. She refused flatly and even expected me to take leave from work and stay at home to accept her certified mail. \n", "State": "DE", "Complaint ID": "1746491", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "Yes", "Date sent to company": "01/18/2016", "Date received": "01/18/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Citibank": 3, "Product": "Credit card", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "198XX"}, {"Issue": "Billing statement", "Company": "Bank of America", "Bank of America": 3, "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "AZ", "Complaint ID": "1746690", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/18/2016", "Date received": "01/18/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit card", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "85258"}, {"Issue": "Incorrect information on credit report", "Company": "Equifax", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "WV", "Product": "Credit reporting", "Complaint ID": "1746832", "Sub-issue": "Information is not mine", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/20/2016", "Date received": "01/18/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Equifax": 3, "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "25312"}, {"Issue": "Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed", "Company": "Encore Capital Group", "Consumer complaint narrative": "Midland Funding LLC attempted to sue me for a credit card debt.

The apartment manager told me there was nothing that she could do since it was at the bill collectors office. Also, I asked her to let me have my apartment back and I would catch up the late rent but she said no. I had only been out of the apartment for a month and a half.

I recently called their customer service to ask for help with an unauthorized charge to my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, after my car broke down, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX for a tow. The tow-truck driver attempted to use my credit card twice as payment for the tow. He told me the charges were declined or failed to go through. As a result, I was forced to pay {$50.00} cash for the tow. Three days later I had XXXX {$50.00} charges on my credit card, which I assumed were from those two attempts. I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I had not authorized the charges, and that I had \" no receipt '' or any other document of such transactions. I expected Capital One, to call either the tow company or its credit provider to find out what the problem was. They clearly did not make any form of contact with either since I spoke to the owner of the tow company. When I called the tow company on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that their records did not show any charges. I was assured that even if my credit card was charged accidentally, the credit will return. This I believe is where a possible scam within Capital One is taking place. I suspect that when a customer calls about unauthorized credit card charges, which Capital One would otherwise have returned had the customer not tipped them off by asking to dispute the claim, rather than crediting the customer 's account, Capital One instead initiates some bogus claim dispute. Capital One asks for documents that it clearly knows do not exist, such as credit receipts for fraudulent charge, which the customer \" has explained do not exist, '' in order to prolong the process or get a customer to default on a claim. Through this process, I suspect that Capital One scams its customers out of money, which it would otherwise have returned to the customers ' credit cards had the customers not asked Capital One for help. Because I refused to accept this, I have been led for 3 months to believe that my claims would be taken care of. I believe Capital One has done nothing the whole time since I have been the XXXX contacting them to get any serious update. For instance, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated that XXXX of my {$50.00} claims was closed. The letter said that the other {$50.00} claim would be rebilled to the merchant, and if the merchant recharges my card, then it would be closed as well. When I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX for updates, I got all kinds of obvious excuses. I was told that based on the document I sent, none of my claims were strong enough. So, I should dispute the claims with the merchant. They did not mention anything about the rebill to the merchant, which was strange since my credit card was recharged only {$50.00} suggesting that the other {$50.00} supposedly rebilled was likely just another last minute excuse, considering all they had to do was add or subtract numbers. Furthermore, about a month ago, Capital One was uncooperative when the tow company owner asked me for documents to show his credit company to look into my dispute. Capital One created an impression that if I sent them a copy of my original \" cash receipt, '' they would fight the dispute. Yet, during the XX/XX/XXXX phone call, I was told that based on the receipt I sent, they did not feel I had a strong case worth fighting for. I have had smaller credit charges to my account in the past, which they have not even requested a single document, and which were less credible than this one. I feel that they may be bias against me perhaps because I recently opened a {$4000.00} credit line with XXXX XXXX. I was also recently forced to close my Capital One bank account because they started charging me monthly fees, around XX/XX/XXXX, even though when I opened the account I was guaranteed no monthly charges. \n", "State": "NY", "Complaint ID": "1724587", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/01/2016", "Date received": "01/01/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit card", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "105XX"}, {"Issue": "Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed", "Company": "Commonwealth Financial Systems, Inc.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "MD", "Complaint ID": "1724530", "Sub-issue": "Debt is not mine", "Company public response": "Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law", "Submitted via": "Web", "Commonwealth Financial Systems, Inc.": 3, "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/06/2016", "Date received": "01/01/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "Medical", "Tags": "", "Product": "Debt collection", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "21227"}, {"Issue": "Improper use of my credit report", "Company": "TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "all fraudulent inquiries : XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as well they do n't list that i only now have XXXX XXXX account and the credit limit is XXXX i have told these people and told these people about my ex wife becoming upset over child support issues and trying to ruin my credit and they fail to do anything. \n", "TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc.": 3, "State": "NC", "Complaint ID": "1724659", "Sub-issue": "Report improperly shared by CRC", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "Yes", "Date sent to company": "01/05/2016", "Date received": "01/01/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "", "Tags": "", "Product": "Credit reporting", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "276XX"}, {"Issue": "Loan servicing, payments, escrow account", "Company": "Flagstar Bank", "Flagstar Bank": 3, "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "State": "NJ", "Complaint ID": "1724585", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "Company chooses not to provide a public response", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/01/2016", "Date received": "01/01/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "FHA mortgage", "Tags": "", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "07430"}, {"Issue": "Account opening, closing, or management", "Company": "BBVA Compass", "Complaint ID": "1724544", "Consumer complaint narrative": "I applied for a BBVA Compass account and they denied me saying \" UNABLE TO VERIFY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION ''.

I would never be late on a payment because I really want to keep my properties, so I called the representatives again. This usually requires hours of wait time and being shuffled around and calling repeatedly. \nDuring these hours, it came to light that the {$500.00} payment I made to lower the escrow shortage was applied to principal as was the {$1300.00} XX/XX/XXXX payment made in XX/XX/XXXX. \nNationstar corrected all this, figured out m new payment amount of {$1300.00} and I am now, once again in good standing, ahead one month. \nExcept that On XX/XX/XXXX, I got a letter rejecting a new loan application to replace loan # XXXX, a loan I had never applied for! Then my statement sent XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX, XXXX shows that the payment is {$1300.00}, including a late fee and an overdue payment fee. My XX/XX/XXXX payment was made XX/XX/XXXX and I just made another payment for XX/XX/XXXX. \nI do n't know whether Nationstar is just inept or if there is an evil intention here to nullify, by any means possible, my modified loan. I really need some help. \nThank you for investigating this situation. I am just trying to hold onto my property as I am old now and this is my life 's investment. \n", "State": "NM", "Complaint ID": "1724787", "Sub-issue": "", "Company public response": "", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "No", "Date sent to company": "01/02/2016", "Date received": "01/02/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent provided", "Sub-product": "Conventional fixed mortgage", "Tags": "Older American", "Product": "Mortgage", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "Yes", "ZIP code": "875XX"}, {"Issue": "Disclosure verification of debt", "Company": "CCS Financial Services, Inc.", "Consumer complaint narrative": "", "CCS Financial Services, Inc.": 3, "State": "CA", "Complaint ID": "1724522", "Sub-issue": "Not given enough info to verify debt", "Company public response": "Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding", "Submitted via": "Web", "Consumer disputed?": "Yes", "Date sent to company": "01/02/2016", "Date received": "01/02/2016", "Consumer consent provided?": "Consent not provided", "Sub-product": "Medical", "Tags": "Older American", "Product": "Debt collection", "Company response to consumer": "Closed with explanation", "Timely response?": "No", "ZIP code": "95747"}, {"Issue": "Account opening, closing, or management", "Company": "Cathay Bank", "Cathay Bank": 3, "Consumer complaint narrative": "I have had a basic, no monthly fee bank account with XXXX Bank until around middle of 2015 when XXXX Bank was acquired by Cathay Bank and all the XXXX Bank accounts were transferred under Cathay Bank.

I just feel like I 'm drowning in these payments to Navient and I have n't seen my principal balance go down at all in 5 years of paying them. I already pay on my Federal student loans as well. I just do n't know where to go from here or how to get a lower interest rate so that I can start making a dent in my debt.

XXXX XXXX XXXX has since acknowledged that they did, indeed, receive the router as required, since we produced the tracking number and a copy of the delivery receipt signed by their shipment center. \n\nHowever, they sold the erroneous collection, and never cancelled it with the original collection company they hired - which began this circus years ago. Since then, XXXX has cleared our credit report, but new collection companies attempt to charge us, and report the collection as a recent debt when it is neither recent XXXX XXXX XXXX and nor outstanding. In fact, if the collection companies contact the original creditor, XXXX, they will confirm it is not outstanding. However, that does not stop them from reselling the debt after we prove the collection is an error. \n\nWe have filed disputes with the bureaus and he collection drops off for a while. Then, a new company reports it, and it 's back on. It 's reprehensible. Hopefully a letter from the CFPB will resolve it once and for all. Because, really, if you can not, who can? \n\nSo, every year, we receive collection notices from yet another collection company for this debt. And because they KNOWINGLY REPORT IT AS RECENT ( XXXX ), they are causing us harm by intentionally misreporting false information and refusing to check the validity of the debt. \n\nThis has been going on for 5 years. 5 years. Every time it happens, we must sit on the phone for hours, track down or paperwork AGAIN, and argue with yet another collection company that gets paid pennies to collect debts. Further, after we resolve it, these horrible companies sell it AGAIN, and it reports on our credit again. \n\nIt 's beyond stressful, frustrating and criminal. Please help us make this cycle stop. We are trying to refinance, and this has effected the interest rate we will receive. We have to pay more to order a re-score credit report, to have our score improve in order to get a more favorable rate. \n\nWhy is this allowed? How come these collection companies have to perform NO DUE DILIGENCE before they negatively effect our credit, yet we have to deal with their incompetence for years? \nThis has meant the difference between XXXX % in interest rates, all because there is no one enforcing the rules. \nThis is simply criminal and we are at our wits end. I am in tears every time another collection company starts the cycle again. Why ca n't they just stop selling this erroneous debt to other collectors, intentionally ruining our credit month after month. \nIt is a fact - we prove the debt is not ours, and the collection company sells it to Someone else, starting the cycle again. \n\nAFNI, Inc. is no different. They have proof we do not owe this. But they have reported the debt as created XXXX - that is NOT accurate! This debt is from XXXX. XXXX is likely when THEY purchased the debt. But, since they only earn money if it is paid, they will keep misreporting it because, who is going to stop them? Really? The disputes do not. They just start reporting again. \n\nDO we have any financial reparations for this? Is XXXX Responsible? Are n't the collections companies required to perform due diligence before they report on credit? And, do n't they have to actually report CORRECT info?
