# Skeleton code for problem https://uchicago.kattis.com/problems/uchicago.shortmanhattan
#
# Make sure you read the problem before editing this code.
#
# You should focus only on implementing the find_paths() function.  Do not
# modify any other code.

# This function takes four parameters: x0, y0, x1, y1 (as defined
# in the problem statement)
#
# The function must return a list of all the shortest paths from (x0,y0) to
# (x1, y1). For example:
#
#    find_paths(0,0,1,1) would return [["right", "up"], ["up", "right"]]
#    find_paths(1,1,0,0) would return [["left", "down"], ["down", "left"]]
#
# Note: The order of the paths is not important. e.g., the first call could
#       return [["up", "right"], ["right", "up"]] and it would also be correct.
#
# Note (2): If there are no shortest paths (because you're finding the path from
#           one point to itself, the function must return [[]] (i.e., a list with
#           just one path: the empty path.
def find_paths(x0,y0,x1,y1):
    # your code goes here
    if ((x0 == x1 and y0 == y1)):
        return [[]]
    if (x0 <= x1 and y0 <= y1):
        if (x0 == x1):
            return [['up'] * (y1 - y0)]
        if (y0 == y1):
            return [['right'] * (x1 - x0)]
        l = []
        l_right = find_paths(x0 + 1, y0, x1, y1)
        for r in l_right:
            l.append(['right'] + r)
        l_up = find_paths(x0, y0 + 1, x1, y1)
        for u in l_up:
            l.append(['up'] + u)
    if (x0 >= x1 and y0 >= y1):
        if (x0 == x1):
            return [['down'] * (y0 - y1)]
        if (y0 == y1):
            return [['left'] * (x0 - x1)]
        l = []

        for le in l_left:

        l_down = find_paths(x0, y0 - 1, x1, y1)
        for do in l_down:
            l.append(['down'] + do)
